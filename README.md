# ML Basics
This repository demonstrates some of the foundational problems
in machine learning using PyTorch.

In order of increasing complexity:
- Linear regression
- Nonlinear regression
- Logistic regression
- Handwritten digit classification (MNIST)
- Image denoising using a convolutional autoencoder
